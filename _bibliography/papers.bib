  abstract={In recent years, the advances in digitalisation have also adversely contributed to the significant rise in cybercrimes. Hence, building the threat intelligence to shield against rising cybercrimes has become a fundamental requisite. Internet Protocol (IP) addresses play a crucial role in the threat intelligence and prevention of cyber crimes. However, we have noticed the lack of one-stop, free, and open-source tools that can analyse IP addresses. Hence, this work introduces a comprehensive web tool for advanced IP address characterisation. Our tool offers a wide range of features, including geolocation, blocklist check, VPN detection, proxy detection, bot detection, Tor detection, port scan, and accurate domain statistics that include the details about the name servers and registrar information.
      In addition, our tool calculates a confidence score based on a weighted sum of publicly accessible online results from different reliable sources to give users a dependable measure of accuracy. Further, to improve performance, our tool also incorporates a local database for caching the results, to enable fast content retrieval with minimal external Web API calls. Our tool supports domain names and IPv4 addresses, making it a multi-functional and powerful IP analyser tool for threat intelligence.},

  abstract={The antibiotic colistin is regarded as the final line of defense for treating infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria. The combination of Raman spectroscopy (RS) with diverse machine learning methods has helped unravel the complexity of various microbiology problems. This approach offers a culture-free, rapid, and objective tool for identifying antimicrobial resistance (AMR). In this study, we employed the combinatorial approach of machine learning and RS to identify a novel spectral marker associated with phosphoethanolamine modification in the lipid A moiety of colistin-resistant Gram-negative Escherichia coli. The visible spectral fingerprints of this marker have been validated using partial least squares regression and discriminant analysis. The origin of the spectral feature was confirmed through hyperspectral imaging and K-means clustering of a single bacterial cell. The chemical structure of the modified lipid A moiety was verified by employing gold standard MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Our findings support the futuristic applicability of this spectroscopic marker in objectively identifying colistin-sensitive and -resistant strains.},

  title={Validating the utility of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide) as a potential Raman spectroscopic probe for identification of antibiotic resistance.},

  journal={Spectrochimica Acta Part A: Molecular and Biomolecular Spectroscopy},
  abstract={The impact of microbial infections is increasing over time, and it is one of the major reasons for death in both developed and developing countries. colistin is considered as the antibiotic of last choice for infections brought by major multidrug-resistant (MDR), gram-negative bacteria such as Enterobacter species, Acinetobacter species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Existing approaches to diagnose these resistant species are relatively slow and take up to 2 to 3 days. In this work, we propose a novel interdisciplinary method based on Raman spectroscopy and heavy water to identify colistin-resistant microbes. Our hypothesis is based on the fact that resistant bacteria will be metabolically active in the culture medium containing antibiotics and heavy water, and these bacteria will take up deuterium instead of hydrogen to newly synthesized lipids and proteins. This effect will generate a ‘C − D’ bond-specific Raman spectral marker. Successful identification of this band in the spectral profile can confirm the presence of colistin-resistant bacteria. We have validated the efficacy of this approach in identifying colistin-resistant bacteria spiked in artificial urine and have compared sensitivity at different bacterial concentrations. Overall findings suggest that heavy water can potentially serve as a suitable Raman probe for identifying metabolically active colistin-resistant bacteria via urine under clinically implementable time and can be used in clinical settings after validation.},
