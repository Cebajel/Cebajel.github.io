I am a passionate researcher with diverse academic and extracurricular interests. My research experience includes using machine learning extensively in bacterial resistance detection, where I developed scripts and leveraged various models, and creating an automated timetable scheduler to solve constraint satisfaction problems. I am also well-versed in cybersecurity, having developed a feature-rich IP analyzer tool funded by Bharat Police Research and Development (BPR&D). A two-month corporate stint at Texas Instruments further honed my ability to apply theoretical insights to practical challenges.

Beyond academics, I have varied interests. I delivered a talk on the significance of game theory in sustainable development at the Indo-Finnish Joint Course and represented IIT Dharwad at the 12th Inter IIT Tech Meet hosted by IIT Madras. In my leisure time, I play the flute and pursue speed cubing, with a personal best of 15 seconds. I also enjoy lawn tennis, where I achieved a 3rd rank at Keel Maha Kumbh, Gujarat. Academically, I have consistently excelled, scoring a perfect 10 GPA in two consecutive semesters and maintaining a current CGPA of 9.74 on a 10-point scale.

Driven by a commitment to innovation, precision, and balanced growth, I aim to make meaningful contributions to both research and personal pursuits.
