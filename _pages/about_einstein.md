I am a passionate researcher with expertise in machine learning, cybersecurity, and optimization. My research endeavors include using machine learning to enhance bacterial resistance detection and developing an automated timetable scheduler to solve constraint satisfaction problems. I also created a comprehensive IP analyzer tool, funded by [Bharat Police Research and Development (BPR&D)](https://bprd.nic.in), to advance cybersecurity solutions.

Academically, I have consistently excelled, achieving a *perfect 10 GPA* in two consecutive semesters and maintaining a current CGPA of *9.74 on a 10-point scale*. During my two-month tenure at [Texas Instruments](https://www.ti.com), I optimized Python scripts for project issue analysis, reducing runtimes from *8–10 hours to 22–30 minutes*. This accomplishment earned me a *Pre-Placement Offer*, reflecting my ability to deliver impactful and efficient solutions.

Outside of academics, I actively pursue diverse extracurricular interests. I delivered a talk on the significance of game theory in sustainable development at the *Indo-Finnish Joint Course* and *represented IIT Dharwad* at the *12th Inter IIT Tech Meet* hosted by IIT Madras. My hobbies include playing the flute, speed cubing with a personal best of 15 seconds, and competing in lawn tennis, where I secured *3rd rank* at Khel Maha Kumbh, Gujarat.

Balancing academic rigor, professional accomplishments, and personal passions, I strive to make meaningful contributions across all domains.
